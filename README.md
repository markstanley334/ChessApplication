#Project: JavaFX Chess Application

##Description: A chess program made outside of school that allows the user to play games of chess with themself and view the moves.


When development is complete, I will add a downloadable program available for anyone to try. 

To see the application currently, see the video or set up the project yourself:

#Steps to set up the project:

- Clone the repository
- Open the project in intelliJ IDEA
- If you do not have JavaFX bundled with your JDK, you will need to download it and add it as a library to the project structure
- Configure JavaFX in run configurations: add the following link in the VM Options field in + > Application > VM options: --module-path PATH --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml (replacing PATH with the path to the lib directory in the JavaFX SDK folder.

- Launch the GameApplication file and view the project!  


#**Note: This project is currently in active development. New features and bug fixes are being worked on.**
